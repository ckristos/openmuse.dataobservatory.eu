`Open Music Europe` brings together music industry stakeholders and researchers from 11 EU countries and Ukraine. Our consortium recognises that placing European music ecosystems on a more competitive, fair, and sustainable footing requires evidence-based policymaking, business planning and accuracy. We provide the data needed for these actions.

Using transparent methods and tools, `Open Music Europe` (official abbreviation: OpenMusE) maps the policy as well as the data landscape. The project bridges data gaps and empowers stakeholders and policymakers to take data-driven actions. Our project is grounded on principles of open policy analysis, open science, and open-source software development. We work with stakeholders to identify data gaps on the EU, national, and regional levels; co-create indicators and methods for bridging them; develop free software tools for data collection and analysis; and report our findings and every step taken to reach them.

Using the [Open Music Observatory](/resources/open-music-observatory/) pillars added to the prototype of the future _European Music Observatory_, i.e., the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) and our [open-source software](/software), music MSMEs without technical departments or expertise will be able to access and analyse open data; model volume and value, including of zero-price uses; create better business models; and generate corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports; all at a fraction of current costs. We validate these tools in four pilot studies that will bring concrete benefits to stakeholders within the project lifespan.

Our data pillars are following the structure laid out in the [Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory](post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/): `WP1` [Music Economy](https://music.dataobservatory.eu//pillars/music-and-society/); `WP2` [Diversity & Circulation](https://music.dataobservatory.eu//pillars/diversity-circulatoin/); `WP3` [Music & Society](https://music.dataobservatory.eu//pillars/music-and-society/) and `WP4` [Innovation - innovative data applications](https://music.dataobservatory.eu//#usecases).
